# parameter_elimination_test
When performing a data analysis, sometimes people come across a problem of checking null hypothesis for normality without knowing parameters of the distribution. 
In this case we should use tests like "Parameters Elimination Method". PEM test allows us to get rid of `mu` and `sigma^2` and move from performing a test for normality to 
performing a test for uniform distribution with parameters 0, 1.
